# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview of Analysis

  1.  Create a branch from the main branch on GitHub.
  3.  Merge a branch with the main branch on GitHub.
  4.  Retrieve data from a GeoJSON file.
  5.  Make API requests to a server to host geographical maps.
  6.  Populate geographical maps with GeoJSON data using JavaScript and the Data-Driven Documents (D3) library.
  7.  Add multiple map layers to geographical maps using Leaflet control plugins to add user interface controls.
  8.  Use JavaScript ES6 functions to add GeoJSON data, features, and interactivity to maps.
  9.  Render maps on a local serve
  
## Purpose

   Create an interactive map using data tools to show the differences in magnitude across 7 days. Using the data in relation to the tectonic plate's location on earth, and visualizing earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5.
